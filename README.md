# screen-break
A friendly little app that reminds you to take a break every hour.

Built with TKinter and Python Screen Break opens a pop up window every hour with a firendly remidner to take a break, a recomendation for what to do and a streak counter.
Works on Mac, Windows and Linux, but only tested on Mac(for now)
